Gym Management System - Spring Boot BackendA comprehensive, robust backend for a gym management system built with Spring Boot. This application provides a complete RESTful API for managing members, subscriptions, class bookings, and authentication, with role-based access control for different user types.‚ú® FeaturesUser Authentication: Secure user registration and login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Passwords are encrypted using BCrypt.Role-Based Authorization: The system supports different roles (MEMBER, STAFF, ADMIN) with protected endpoints ensuring users can only access authorized resources. Admins can register Staff and other Admins.Membership Management: Admins can create and manage different types of membership plans (e.g., Monthly, Quarterly, Annual).Subscription Handling: Members can subscribe to a membership plan, with automatic start and end date calculation.Class Booking System: Authenticated members with an active subscription can book available classes. The system validates class capacity before confirming a booking.Attendance Tracking: Members can mark their check-in attendance.Payment Processing: A dummy endpoint to simulate payment processing for subscriptions.üõ†Ô∏è Tech StackJava 17Spring Boot 3: For building the RESTful API.Spring Security: For handling authentication and authorization.Spring Data JPA (Hibernate): For database interaction.MySQL: Relational database for data persistence.Lombok: To reduce boilerplate code.jjwt: For creating and validating JSON Web Tokens.‚öôÔ∏è System ArchitectureThe application follows a classic layered architecture on the backend to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.Controller Layer: Exposes the REST API endpoints and handles incoming HTTP requests.Service Layer: Contains all the business logic (e.g., checking if a user has an active subscription).Repository Layer: Handles data access and communication with the MySQL database using Spring Data JPA.Security Layer: Intercepts requests to validate JWTs and enforce authorization rules.üöÄ Setup and RunPrerequisitesJava JDK 17 or laterMaven 3.8 or laterMySQL ServerA REST client like Postman or cURL.Backend SetupClone the repository:git clone <your-repo-url>
cd GymManagementBackend
Configure the database:Open src/main/resources/application.properties.Update spring.datasource.url, spring.datasource.username, and spring.datasource.password to match your local MySQL configuration.Update the JWT secret key application.security.jwt.secret-key. You can generate a Base64-encoded 256-bit key online.Run the application:mvn spring-boot:run
The backend server will start on http://localhost:8080.üß™ API Endpoints & Sample QueriesHere are sample cURL requests to test the API endpoints.Note: For protected endpoints, first log in to get a JWT token.
